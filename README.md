- The above ERD shows the different tables and their relations. To get information like who is retiring and from where you need to join multiple tables. 

- To accomplish the total count of employees retiring by title the employees and titles tables were joined. The relevant information was there to set filters and apply conditions to inform of us the number of unique titles retiring in the coming years.

## Preparing Defenses and Relief

- With this new information the company decides to set a mentor ship program in place. This will allow the company to retain viral information and ensure a smooth transition. 

- With the creation of databases our company learned vital information. The company then stored this information and set in place action plans based on the data.
